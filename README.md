# Data-Labelling-System

As an example, your data labeling system can be used to label customer comments in a e-commerce web site as Positive or Negative. This is known as sentiment classification problem. In another example the same system can be used to label news from an online newspaper articles as sports, world, economy, politics, other. This is called as news classificaiton problem.
In some datasets an instance may labeled with only a single class label. In other datasets a single instance can be assigned more than one class labels. This will be given as an input along with the dataset and a set of class labels that are available for labeling.
In some datasets the whole text is labeled such as in sentiment classification. In others words or phrases inside an instance (document) can be labeled such as in Named Entity Recognition problem.
